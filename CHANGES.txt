Server
++++++

There are now 4 processes, controlled by a ``supervisor`` daemon:

  + `schooltool`    - schooltool web application
  + `zeo` - ``ZEO`` server allows many clients to use the same ``ZODB`` storage
  + `celery_report` - a ``celery`` task queue that generates reports
  + `redis`         - a simple key-value database for ``celery``

New ``make`` targets:


  + start       - start all processes as daemons
  + stop        - stop all processes
  + restart     - restart `schooltool` and `celery` processes
  + rerun       - stop `schooltool` and run again in the foreground. restarts `celery`
  + status      - status of all processes

Upgrade notes
+++++++++++++

`Redis` server is written in C and needs to be installed separately. On Ubuntu
or Debian::

    $ sudo apt-get install redis-server

Instances have to be updated to run this version. If you run from a sandbox::

    $ bin/make-schooltool-instance instance

Ubuntu package ``schooltool`` contains updated configuration files. If they have
been modified, you may be asked how to handle the conflicts. So it is
recommended to upgrade it in the terminal::

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install schooltool
